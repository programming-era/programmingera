    "title": "MySQL vs MongoDB -  How to Choose the Right Database for Your Needs",
    "body": "2023/11/15 - MySQL vs MongoDB: How to Choose the Right Database for Your NeedsMySQL and MongoDB are two of the most popular open-source databases used today. MySQL is a relational database, while MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. Both have their own strengths and weaknesses, so how do you choose which one is right for your application? In this article, we’ll compare MySQL and MongoDB across several factors to help you decide which database better suits your needs. Structural Differences: The core structural difference between MySQL and MongoDB comes down to how they model data. MySQL structures data into tables with rows and columns, with predefined schemas and relationships between tables. MongoDB stores unstructured “documents” in JSON format, with no schemas imposed on the documents. This means MySQL is better suited for applications that require ACID transactions and complex joins across well-structured data. MongoDB is ideal for applications with unpredictable or rapidly changing data schemas that don’t require strong relational links between entities. Performance: MySQL traditionally has better performance for simple queries, while MongoDB handles complex aggregation queries more efficiently. MySQL also tends to perform better for highly structured data models with properly indexed fields. MongoDB can more easily take advantage of nested documents and arrays to retrieve related data in a single query. However, with correct indexing, MySQL can also achieve high performance across related tables using joins. Overall, both databases can achieve high performance with optimal schema design and indexing. Scalability: MongoDB was designed for high scalability and availability. Its distributed architecture allows for easy horizontal scaling by sharding across servers. MySQL’s architecture is less distributed, so high scalability requires more work to achieve through sharding, partitioning, or replication. MongoDB also handles more operational load by default with built-in connection pooling, replication, and auto-failover. MySQL’s capabilities have improved greatly in recent versions, but still requires more manual administration to build comparable high availability. Functionality: Both databases now overlap significantly in core functionality like indexing, transactions, aggregation pipelines, and JSON support. However, MySQL still has more mature and enterprise-ready capabilities as a relational database like triggers, stored procedures, and strict ACID compliance. MongoDB has more flexible document schemas, better geospatial support, and abilities like TTL indexes to automatically expire old documents. So consider which specific features are priorities for your use case. Ecosystem: As a long-established open-source database, MySQL benefits from broader adoption, community support, surrounding tools, and integrations with every major language and framework. MongoDB has a smaller ecosystem, but also has excellent support across languages. So while MySQL may have an edge in maturity here, MongoDB is no slouch and continues to grow its supporting ecosystem. This factor may not play a huge role depending on your application’s tech stack. Conclusion: There’s no universally superior database - choosing MySQL or MongoDB depends on weighing factors like your data structure, scalability needs, functionality requirements, and existing tech stack. Relational models and rock-solid ACID compliance favor MySQL, while flexible schemas and greater scalability are MongoDB strengths. Measure both against your application’s specific needs to make the right choice. "

    "body": "2023/11/15 - # Boost Your VS Code Productivity with These Must Have ExtensionsVisual Studio Code is loved by developers for its flexibility and extensibility. With the right extensions, you can customize VS Code to fit your exact workflow and coding needs. In this post, we’ll look at 10 of the most useful VS Code extensions that can help make you more productive. Whether you work with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS or Python, there are extensions here to help speed up your development. Optimize Code Quality withESLintPrettier andEditorConfig: Maintaining a consistent code style across projects is challenging, especially when working in teams. Fortunately, ESLint, Prettier and EditorConfig help automate code formatting and linting. ESLint analyzes your code for potential errors and fixes problems related to code quality. Prettier then formats the code according to your configured style rules. Lastly, EditorConfig sets up project-level formatting rules that your team can agree on. Together, these extensions enforce consistent code style and quality automatically - saving you time and headaches. Refactor Code Faster withVisual Studio IntelliCode: IntelliCode utilizes AI assistance to provide intelligent code completions and suggestions in VS Code. As you type, it will infer the most relevant methods and properties for the current context based on your code and its type information. This speeds up development tremendously when working with JavaScript and TypeScript. IntelliCode can even suggest entire lines of code to call APIs or access objects accurately. The AI assistance pays off in boosting your productivity. Catch Typos Early UsingCode Spell Checker: Small typos in code comments, strings or function names can be frustrating to locate and fix. The Code Spell Checker extension identifies these spelling mistakes as you type and suggests corrections. You can also add custom words and abbreviations specific to your project - ensuring team consistency. Stop repeated typos and spelling inconsistencies wasting your time during development. Rename Files Intelligently withGit Rename: When refactoring code, renaming files properly so Git tracks the changes correctly can be a hassle. The Git Rename extension takes the pain out of this by handling all the Git commands needed when renaming files. No more deleting and re-adding files to change case or naming. Git Rename enables seamless file renaming and moving across folders within your Git repository. Never Forget to Close HTML Tags withAuto Rename Tag: When editing HTML files with many nested elements, it’s easy to miss closing tags. The Auto Rename Tag extension is a simple but mighty helper that automatically renames matching opening and closing tags as you make edits. No more hunting through code to fix mismatched tags. Auto Rename Tag ensures your HTML stays clean and valid with minimal effort. Write Better Code withVisual Studio IntelliSense: IntelliSense provides intelligent code completions, signature info and quick info tooltips as you type in the editor. This context-aware assistance helps you write code faster with fewer errors. IntelliSense works for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, CSS and more.

    "body": "2023/11/14 - At the heart of all application is the database where all data related to the application is stored. In a series of posts I’ll be discussing how Database Management Systems are used in applications development. In this introductory post I’ll be giving a quick overview of some Database terms. Whats is a Database Management Systems?A Database Management Systems is a software used to properly store, retrieve and update data in a database. A database is a collection of interrelate data. A view is a subset of data returned from a query (A query is a request for data from a database). A view hides unnecessary details away from users and provide security to prevent users from accessing restricted data. The structure of data is very important in database management systems. The overall design of a database is called a Schema. Schema describes the logical design of a database. Schemas are the blueprint of how the database will be constructed. The data model is a way to describe your data, relationships in your data and data consistency and constraints. There are four type of data models:  Relation Model Entity-Relationship Model Object-based Data Model Semistructured Data ModelThe Relation Model and the Entity-Relationship Model are the most widely used data models. Database System provides a data-definition language that is used to specify the database schema and a data-manipulation language that is used to interact with the database. These are not two separate languages, they form a single database language, such as the widely used SQL (Which we will be discussing in a later post). DBMS needs to ensure data is safe in the event of crashes and against unauthorized access. Since data in application are usually shared among multiple users, the DBMS must avoid inconsistent result. Application often perform multiple operations on the database that count as one unit of work. Transaction must hold the following set of properties: Atomicity Consistency Isolation DurabilityThese properties guarantees reliability even in the event of errors or power failure. Transactions that are performed concurrently must be executed with out conflict. Data is important to every application. The database can be considered the heart of an application. In the coming series of posts I will be going in depth about different database topics using a well-know application as an example. "

    "title": "Creating Your First Website for Beginners: From Github to Netlify",
    "body": "2023/03/03 -   Creating your first website can be a daunting task, but with the right resources and tools, it can be an exciting and rewarding experience. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the process of creating a simple website for beginners and deploying it on Netlify. Step 1: Setting up your development environmentBefore you start building your website, you'll need to set up your development environment. You'll need a text editor to write your code, a web browser to test your website, and Git to manage your code. For this tutorial, we recommend using Visual Studio Code as your text editor and Google Chrome as your web browser. Git comes pre-installed on most operating systems, but if you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website. Step 2: Creating your websiteOnce you have your development environment set up, it's time to create your website. For this tutorial, we'll create a simple website that displays a heading and a paragraph. First, create a new folder on your computer and name it  my-website . Then, open Visual Studio Code and create a new file in the  my-website  folder. Name the file  index. html  and add the following code:  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;	&lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;	&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my website&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;This code creates a basic HTML page with a heading and a paragraph. Save the file and open it in your web browser to see the result. Step 3: Pushing your website to GitHubNow that you've created your website, it's time to push it to GitHub. GitHub is a platform for hosting and managing your code repositories. First, create a new repository on GitHub. Name the repository  my-website  and make it public. Then, go back to Visual Studio Code and open the terminal. Navigate to the  my-website  folder by typing cd my-website in the terminal. Then, initialize a new Git repository by typing git init. Next, add all the files in the folder to the Git repository by typing git add . . Finally, commit the changes by typing git commit -m  Initial commit . Now, connect your local Git repository to the remote GitHub repository by typing git remote add origin https://github. com/your-username/my-website. git. Replace  your-username  with your GitHub username. Then, push the changes to GitHub by typing git push -u origin main. Step 4: Deploying your website on NetlifyNow that your website is on GitHub, it's time to deploy it on Netlify. Netlify is a platform for hosting and deploying websites. First, sign up for a free account on Netlify. Then, click the  New site from Git  button on the dashboard. Choose GitHub as the source and select the  my-website  repository. Then, click  Deploy site . Netlify will build and deploy your website automatically. Once the deployment is complete, you'll be given a URL for your website. Click the URL to see your website live on the internet. Congratulations, you've created your first website and deployed it on Netlify! This is just the beginning of your web development journey. Keep learning and exploring new technologies to take your skills to the next level. "
