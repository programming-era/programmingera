<h2 id="what-is-the-news">What is the news?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Amazon has announced that it will pay customers up to $1,000 for defective products sold by third-party sellers on its platform, as part of its new A-to-z Guarantee program.</li>
  <li>The program, which will start on September 1, 2023, will cover claims of personal injury or property damage caused by products purchased on Amazon.com.</li>
  <li>Amazon said that it will handle the claims directly, without requiring customers to contact the sellers or manufacturers.
    <h2 id="why-did-they-do-that">Why did they do that?</h2>
  </li>
  <li>There are several possible reasons why Amazon decided to launch this program. Some of them are:</li>
  <li>To improve customer trust and satisfaction, by offering a hassle-free and reliable way to resolve issues with defective products.</li>
  <li>To reduce legal risks and liabilities, by taking responsibility for the products sold on its platform, and avoiding potential lawsuits from customers or regulators.</li>
  <li>To increase its competitive edge, by differentiating itself from other online marketplaces that may not offer such guarantees or protections.</li>
  <li>To encourage more third-party sellers to join its platform, by providing them with a safety net and a lower barrier to entry.
    <h2 id="how-can-it-benefit">How can it benefit?</h2>
  </li>
  <li>The program can benefit various stakeholders in different ways. Some of them are:</li>
  <li>Customers can benefit from having a peace of mind and a convenient way to get compensation for defective products, without having to deal with the sellers or manufacturers directly.</li>
  <li>Sellers can benefit from having a lower risk of losing customers or facing legal troubles, as Amazon will handle the claims on their behalf.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers can benefit from having a lower cost of quality control and customer service, as Amazon will cover the expenses of the claims.</li>
  <li>Amazon can benefit from having a higher customer loyalty and retention, a larger seller base, and a stronger brand reputation.
    <h2 id="what-is-it-going-to-change">What is it going to change?</h2>
  </li>
  <li>The program is likely to have some impacts on the online retail industry and the consumer behavior. Some of them are:</li>
  <li>It may increase the demand and supply of products sold by third-party sellers on Amazon, as customers may feel more confident and comfortable to buy from them, and sellers may feel more incentivized and supported to sell on Amazon.</li>
  <li>It may raise the standards and expectations of customers, who may demand similar guarantees or protections from other online platforms or retailers, or even from offline stores.</li>
  <li>It may create some challenges or opportunities for competitors, who may have to adapt or innovate to match or surpass Amazon’s offer, or to find other ways to attract and retain customers and sellers.
    <h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h2>
  </li>
  <li>The answer to this question may depend on the perspective and the criteria of the evaluator. Some possible ways to assess the worthiness of the program are:</li>
  <li>Cost-benefit analysis: This involves comparing the costs and benefits of the program, both in monetary and non-monetary terms, and determining whether the benefits outweigh the costs, or vice versa.</li>
  <li>SWOT analysis: This involves identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the program, and evaluating how they affect the performance and the prospects of Amazon and its stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Stakeholder analysis: This involves identifying the interests, needs, and preferences of the various stakeholders involved in or affected by the program, and evaluating how they are satisfied or dissatisfied by the program.

At the heart of all application is the database where all data related to the application is stored.
In a series of posts I’ll be discussing how Database Management Systems are used in applications development.
In this introductory post I’ll be giving a quick overview of some Database terms.</p>
<h1 id="whats-is-a-database-management-systems">Whats is a Database Management Systems?</h1>
<p>A Database Management Systems is a software used to properly store, retrieve and update data in a database. A database is a collection of interrelate data.
A view is a subset of data returned from a query (A query is a request for data from a database). A view hides unnecessary details away from users and provide security to prevent users from accessing restricted data.
The structure of data is very important in database management systems. The overall design of a database is called a Schema. Schema describes the logical design of a database. Schemas are the blueprint of how the database will be constructed.
The data model is a way to describe your data, relationships in your data and data consistency and constraints. There are four type of data models:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Relation Model</li>
  <li>Entity-Relationship Model</li>
  <li>Object-based Data Model</li>
  <li>Semistructured Data Model
The Relation Model and the Entity-Relationship Model are the most widely used data models.
Database System provides a data-definition language that is used to specify the database schema and a data-manipulation language that is used to interact with the database. These are not two separate languages, they form a single database language, such as the widely used SQL (Which we will be discussing in a later post).
DBMS needs to ensure data is safe in the event of crashes and against unauthorized access. Since data in application are usually shared among multiple users, the DBMS must avoid inconsistent result.
Application often perform multiple operations on the database that count as one unit of work. Transaction must hold the following set of properties:</li>
  <li>Atomicity</li>
  <li>Consistency</li>
  <li>Isolation</li>
  <li>Durability
These properties guarantees reliability even in the event of errors or power failure.Transactions that are performed concurrently must be executed with out conflict.
Data is important to every application. The database can be considered the heart of an application.
In the coming series of posts I will be going in depth about different database topics using a well-know application as an example.</li>

<p>As technology continues to advance, the need for cybersecurity professionals, particularly ethical hackers, is increasing. An ethical hacker, also known as a white hat hacker, is a computer security expert who utilizes their hacking skills to identify vulnerabilities in a company’s computer systems and networks.</p>

<p>Becoming an ethical hacker in 2023 can be a rewarding and exciting career choice. With the increase in cyber threats and attacks, there is a high demand for skilled professionals who can protect networks and systems. In this comprehensive guide, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to become an ethical hacker, career opportunities, and internships in India.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-understanding-ethical-hacking">Step 1: Understanding Ethical Hacking</h2>

<p>Before embarking on the journey to become an ethical hacker, it is essential to understand the concept of ethical hacking. Ethical hacking involves identifying vulnerabilities in systems and networks and fixing them before malicious attackers can exploit them. This involves using the same techniques and tools as cybercriminals but for ethical purposes.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-education-and-training">Step 2: Education and Training</h2>

<p>To become an ethical hacker, you need to have a strong foundation in computer science or information technology. A bachelor’s degree in computer science, cybersecurity, or a related field is an excellent starting point. Additionally, gaining certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) can help you gain expertise in ethical hacking.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-build-practical-skills">Step 3: Build Practical Skills</h2>

<p>Practical skills are crucial for any aspiring ethical hacker. You can gain practical experience by participating in bug bounty programs or by setting up a virtual lab to practice penetration testing. Joining a community of like-minded individuals or participating in online forums can also help you build practical skills.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-internships-in-india">Step 4: Internships in India</h2>

<p>Internships are an excellent way to gain practical experience and build a network of contacts in the field of ethical hacking.
