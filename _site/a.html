    <p>Are you interested in creating your first website but don't know where to start? Look no further! In this
        beginner's guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating and deploying your first website using GitHub
        and Netlify.</p>
    <p>Step 1: Choose your tools</p>
    <p>To get started, you'll need to choose the tools you'll use to create your website. For this guide, we'll be using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic website. You'll also need a text editor, like Visual Studio Code, to
        write your code.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Create your website</p>
    <p>Once you've chosen your tools, it's time to start creating your website. Open up your text editor and create a
        new file called index.html. This file will serve as the homepage for your website. Start by adding the basic
        structure of an HTML page:</p>
   <pre>
    <pre>
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Your Website Title Here</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Welcome to Your Website</h1>
          </body>
        </html>  
    </code>
   </pre>
    <p>This will create a basic HTML page with a title and a header that says "Welcome to Your Website."</p>
    <p>Next, you can add some CSS to style your website. Create a new file called style.css and add some basic styles:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            body {
                background-color: #f8f8f8;
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
              }
              
              h1 {
                color: #333;
                text-align: center;
              }              
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This will set the background color of your website to a light gray and change the font family of the body text to
        Arial. It will also center the text in the header and change the color to dark gray.</p>
    <p>Finally, you can add some JavaScript to make your website interactive. Create a new file called script.js and add
        some basic code:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
var header = document.querySelector('h1');
header.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Hello, World!');
});
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This will add an event listener to the header on your website. When the user clicks on the header, it will
        display an alert that says "Hello, World!"</p>
    <p>Step 3: Push your code to GitHub</p>
    <p>Once you've created your website, it's time to share it with the world! To do this, you'll need to push your code
        to GitHub. If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one now.</p>
    <p>Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking on the "New" button on the repositories page. Give your repository
        a name and a description, and choose whether you want it to be public or private. Once you've created your
        repository, you'll see a page with instructions for pushing your code to GitHub.</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions on this page to push your code to GitHub. You'll need to use the command line to do this,
        so make sure you're comfortable with basic command line operations.</p>
    <p>Step 4: Deploy your website using Netlify</p>
    <p>Now that your code is on GitHub, it's time to deploy your website using Netlify. If you don't already have a
        Netlify account, create one now.</p>
    <p>Once you've created your account, click on the "New site from Git" button on the Netlify dashboard. Choose GitHub
        as your Git provider and select the repository you just created. Net</p>
