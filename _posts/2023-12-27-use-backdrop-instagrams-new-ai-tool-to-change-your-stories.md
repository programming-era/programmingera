[__Instagram__](https://www.instagram.com/), which is owned by Meta, has introduced "**Backdrop**," a new AI media editing tool that lets you edit any background image using prompts for Stories. This feature was initially made available to US users by the company users.
Posted in the Generative AI Lead Threads on Meta Al-Dahle, Ahmed In the US, you can use our AI-powered media editing tool Backgrounds on Instagram! With Backgrounds, you can create a completely new image for your Story with just a few taps and an image prompt.
### Where to Find Backdrop, Instagram's New AI Tool
To get started, you have to tap on the backdrop button at the top of the new story. "Once posted, a Try It sticker will appear when you share the created image, making it even easier for your friends to try the new AI editing for the first time," Al-Dahle said. Meanwhile, Instagram is expanding its Close Friends feature beyond Stories and Notes to feed posts and Reels.
Users will now be able to share Reels and Feed posts with a smaller, more trusted group instead of all followers. The company said people use Close Friends as a pressure-free space to connect with the people who matter most. The developers hope that by expanding the Close Friends option to Reels and feed posts, users will have more ways to be your most authentic you on Instagram.
