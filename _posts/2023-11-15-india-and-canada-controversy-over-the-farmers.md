# The India-Canada Controversy over the Farmers’ Protests in India
## Introduction
- The farmers’ protests in India are a series of ongoing demonstrations by farmers and their supporters against three farm laws passed by the Indian government in September 2020.
- The protesters claim that the laws will benefit large corporations and harm the interests and livelihoods of small and marginal farmers, who make up the majority of the agricultural sector in India.
- The protests have been met with resistance and repression by the Indian authorities, who have used force, barricades, internet shutdowns, and arrests to try to disperse and silence the protesters.
- The protests have also attracted international attention and solidarity, especially from the Sikh diaspora, who have a significant presence and influence in countries like Canada, the UK, and the US.
- The controversy between India and Canada over the farmers’ protests started when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his concern and support for the farmers’ right to protest peacefully, which India considered as an interference in its internal affairs.
- The controversy has strained the bilateral relations between the two countries, which have a history of cooperation and trade, but also of tension and mistrust over issues such as human rights, terrorism, and separatism.
## Background
- 
The three farm laws that sparked the protests are:
    - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which allows farmers to sell their produce outside the government-regulated markets (mandis) and enter into contracts with private buyers.
    - The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, which regulates the contract farming system and provides a framework for dispute resolution.
    - The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which removes the stockholding limits on certain commodities and allows the central government to regulate the supply and price of these commodities only under extraordinary circumstances.
- 
The Indian government argues that the laws are aimed at modernizing and liberalizing the agricultural sector, and that they will give farmers more freedom, choice, and income, by eliminating the middlemen and creating a competitive market.
- 
The protesters, however, contend that the laws will expose them to the volatility and exploitation of the market forces, and that they will lose the minimum support price (MSP) and the public procurement system, which guarantee them a fair and stable income.
- 
The protesters also fear that the laws will pave the way for the corporatization and privatization of the agricultural sector, and that they will undermine the federal structure and the autonomy of the states, by encroaching on their legislative and fiscal powers.
- 
The protests began in August 2020, when the laws were first introduced as ordinances, and intensified in November 2020, when thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan marched towards the national capital, New Delhi, to demand the repeal of the laws.
- 
The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been some incidents of violence and clashes between the protesters and the police, especially on January 26, 2021, when some groups of protesters deviated from the agreed route and entered the Red Fort, a historic and symbolic site, and hoisted a religious flag.
- 
The protests have also been marked by the use of various forms of resistance and expression, such as hunger strikes, tractor rallies, road and rail blockades, cultural performances, social media campaigns, and international outreach.
## The Canadian Response
- 
Canada has a large and influential Sikh population, estimated at around 500,000, which constitutes about 1.4% of the total population and 4.8% of the visible minority population of Canada.
- 
Many Canadian Sikhs have ancestral and familial ties to Punjab, the epicenter of the farmers’ protests, and identify with the Sikh faith, culture, and history, which have shaped their political and social activism in Canada and abroad.
- 
The Canadian Sikh community has been vocal and active in supporting the farmers’ protests in India, by organizing rallies, petitions, fundraisers, and awareness campaigns, and by lobbying the Canadian government and the international community to intervene and pressure the Indian government to respect the farmers’ rights and demands.
- 
The Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has a close relationship with the Sikh community and has several Sikh ministers and MPs in his cabinet and party, has also expressed its concern and support for the farmers’ protests in India, albeit in a cautious and diplomatic manner.
- 
The first statement by Trudeau on the issue was made on December 1, 2020, during a virtual event to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. He said:
> 
“I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognizing the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers. The situation is concerning and we’re all very worried about family and friends. I know that’s a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.”
- 
The statement was welcomed and applauded by the Canadian Sikh community and the protesters in India, who saw it as a sign of solidarity and recognition of their cause and struggle.
- 
The statement, however, was strongly condemned and rejected by the Indian government, who saw it as an unwarranted and unacceptable interference in its internal affairs, and as a tacit support for the separatist elements and agendas within the Sikh community, such as the Khalistan movement, which seeks to create an independent Sikh state in Punjab.
- 
The Indian government summoned the Canadian High Commissioner and lodged a formal protest, saying that Trudeau’s remarks were “ill-informed” and “unwarranted” and that they could have a “seriously damaging impact” on the bilateral ties between the two countries.
- 
The Canadian government, in response, maintained that it respected India’s sovereignty and democracy, but also defended its right to speak out on human rights issues, especially when they affect its citizens and their families and friends.
- 
The Canadian government also reiterated its support for a peaceful and constructive dialogue between the Indian government and the protesters, and urged both sides to resolve the issue through democratic means.
- 
The Canadian government also clarified that it does not support any separatist movement or violence, and that it supports a united and pluralistic India.
## The Implications and the Prospects
- The controversy between India and Canada over the farmers’ protests has had some implications and consequences for the bilateral relations between the two countries, which have a history of cooperation and trade, but also of tension and mistrust over issues such as human rights, terrorism, and separatism.
- The controversy has strained the diplomatic and political ties between the two countries, as evidenced by the summoning of the envoy, the cancellation of some official meetings and visits, and the exchange of harsh words and warnings.
- The controversy has also affected the economic and trade relations between the two countries, as evidenced by the suspension of some flights, the delay of some deals and contracts, and the threat of some sanctions and boycotts.
- The controversy has also influenced the public and media perception and opinion of the two countries, as evidenced by the rise of some nationalist and populist sentiments, the spread of some misinformation and propaganda, and the polarization of some debates and discussions.
- The controversy, however, has also created some opportunities and incentives for the two countries to engage and dialogue with each other, and to address and resolve some of the underlying and longstanding issues and challenges that have hampered their relations and cooperation.
- The controversy has also highlighted some of the commonalities and complementarities between the two countries, such as their democratic and multicultural values, their economic and strategic interests, and their diasporic and cultural ties.
- The controversy, therefore, has the potential to either escalate or de-escalate the situation, depending on how the two countries handle and manage it, and how they balance and reconcile their national and international interests and obligations.
## Conclusion
- The controversy between India and Canada over the farmers’ protests in India is a complex and sensitive issue, that involves various actors, factors, and dimensions, such as the farmers, the governments, the laws, the protests, the diaspora, the human rights, the sovereignty, the democracy, the trade, and the security.
- The controversy has had some negative and positive impacts on the bilateral relations between the two countries, which have a history of cooperation and trade, but also of tension and mistrust over issues such as human rights, terrorism, and separatism.
- The controversy has also raised some questions and challenges for the two countries, such as how to respect and protect the rights and interests of their citizens and their partners, how to communicate and negotiate with each other and with the international community, and how to foster and maintain a constructive and cordial relationship and cooperation.
- The controversy, therefore, requires a careful and nuanced analysis and understanding, and a pragmatic and diplomatic approach and solution, that can address and resolve the issue in a peaceful and satisfactory manner, and that can enhance and strengthen the bilateral ties and the mutual trust and respect between the two countries.&nbsp;
