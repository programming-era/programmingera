**5G** is faster than **4G**, but the actual speed difference depends on the specific **carrierâ€™s network** youâ€™re using. Letâ€™s dive into the details:
1. **Download Speeds**:
    - **5G** is already up to **10 times faster** than **4G** in some areas, which is quite impressive.
    - [Theoretically, 5G devices can reach peaks of **20GB per second**, while 4G LTEâ€™s maximum speed is around **1GB per second**](https://www.tomsguide.com/features/5g-vs-4g)[1](https://www.tomsguide.com/features/5g-vs-4g)[2](https://gospeedcheck.com/article/what-is-the-difference-between-5g-vs-4g-speeds-420).
**2. Real-World Comparison**:
    - In our testing of 5G networks across several cities in the past couple of years, weâ€™ve yet to see sustained gigabit speeds that 5G promises. However, this will likely change as carriers continue to build out their networks.
    - Hereâ€™s a comparison of average download speeds:
        - **5G**:
            - AT&amp;T: **75.6 Mbps**
            - Sprint: **70 Mbps**
            - T-Mobile: **71 Mbps**
            - Verizon: **67.1 Mbps**
        - **4G** (based on nationwide average):
            - AT&amp;T: **37.1 Mbps**
            - Sprint: **32.5 Mbps**
            - T-Mobile: **36.3 Mbps**
            - [Verizon: **53.3 Mbps**](https://www.tomsguide.com/features/5g-vs-4g)[1](https://www.tomsguide.com/features/5g-vs-4g).
**3. Coverage**:
    - **4G** still dominates in small towns and rural areas where 5G networks are relatively thin or nonexistent.
    - [However, 5G is gaining ground in many American cities, with speeds ranging from slightly faster than 4G LTE to double the speed or more](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/4g-vs-5g)[3](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/4g-vs-5g).
In summary, while 5G is faster, the actual experience varies based on location, carrier, and network maturity. As 5G networks expand, we can expect even greater speed improvements. ðŸš€ðŸ“¶
